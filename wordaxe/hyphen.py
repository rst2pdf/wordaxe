class HyphenationPoint(object):
    """
    A possible hyphenation point in a HyphenatedWord.
    
    Attributes:
      indx        : The index where to split the word.
      quality     : The quality of this hyphenation point (0=bad,5=average,9=very good).
      nl,sl,nr,sr : Replacement parameters.
      
    Description:
      When we split the word at this hyphenation point,
      we can build the two strings left,right as follows:
      left = word[:pos-nl] + sl
      right = sr + word[pos+nr:]

    Some examples (where q is some quality, i.e. q=5):
    
      The usual case is nl=0,sl="\173",nr=0,sr="".
      In other words, just add a "shy" character to the left string.
      "Lesen" (to read) can be hyphenated as "le-" "sen":
      HyphenationPoint(2,q,0,"\173",0,"")
      
      In some cases, it is not necessary to add the shy character:
      "ABC-Buch" (ABC book) can be hyphenated as "ABC-" "buch":
      HyphenationPoint(4,q,0,"",0,"")
      
      And - especially using the OLD german rules - the case
      nl>0 or nr>0 can occur:
      
      The word "backen" (to bake) can be hyphenated between the "c" and the "k";
      however, the hyphenated version would be "bak-" "ken".
      Thus, the one and only hyphenation point in this word is
      HyphenationPoint(3,q,1,"k"+"\173",0,"")
      
      Another example: According to the old german rules, the word "Schiffahrt"
      is a concatenation of "Schiff" (ship) and "fahrt" (journey).
      The triple "f" is shortened to a double "f".
      But in case of hyphenation, it's three "f"s again: "Schiff-" "fahrt".
      HyphenationPoint(5,q,0,"f"+shy,0,"")
      This could also be expressed as HyphenationPoint(6,q,0,shy,0,"f").

class Hyphenator:
    """
    Hyphenator serves as the base class for all hyphenation implementation classes.
    
    Some general thoughts about hyphenation follow.
    
    Hyphenation is language specific.
    Hyphenation is encoding specific.
    Hyphenation does not use the context of a word.
    Good Hyphenation enables the reader to read fluently,
    bad hyphenation can make a word hard to read.
    
    Hyphenation is language specific:
    The same word may be valid in several languages,
    and the valid hyphenation points can depend on the language.
    Example: Situation
   
    Hyphenation is encoding specific:
    This is just an implementation detail really,
    however an important one.
    For example, every hyphenation algorithm uses some internal
    encoding scheme, and it should document this scheme.
    How is the input encoding and the output encoding?
    
    Hyphenation does not use the context of the word:
    Surely, it could make sense to "understand" the context.
    There may be some words that should be hyphenated differently
    depending on the context.
    But this would make a really BIG overhead;
    and I can't really think of an example. It's not worth thinking about it.
    
    Good Hyphenation enables the reader to read fluently,
    bad hyphenation can make a word hard to read.
    Some languages, for example german, make frequent use of
    the concatenation of several simple words to build more complex words,
    like "Hilberts Nullstellensatz" (something I remember from Algebra).
    Null = Zero
    Stelle = Place, Location
    Satz = Theorem (math)
 
    The one famous example for bad german hyphenation is the word "Urinstinkt".
    This is made up of
    Ur = Primal
    Instinkt = Instinct
   
    These thoughts have led to the following interface for hyphenation.
